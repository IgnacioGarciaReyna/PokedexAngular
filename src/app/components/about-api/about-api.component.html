    <h3>¿What is this site about?</h3>
    <p>
      This page was developed for my personal portfolio. It is my first project, based on the info provided by the PokeAPI. Implementing this API allows me to handle a lot of information, get many characteristics and show the data on my page.

    <h3>What is the PokeAPI?</h3>
    <p>
      The PokeAPI website provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects
      built from thousands of lines of data related to Pokémon. They specifically
      cover the video game franchise. Using this website, you can consume
      information on Pokémon, their moves, abilities, types, egg groups and
      much, much more.

    <h3>What is an API?</h3>
    <p>
      An API (Application Programming Interface) is a contract that allow
      developers to interact with an application through a set of interfaces. In
      this case, the application is a database of thousands of Pokémon-related
      objects, and the interfaces are URL links. A RESTful API is an API that
      conforms to a set of loose conventions based on HTTP verbs, errors, and
      hyperlinks.
